# MATH-237-Project-1
Hello and welcome to the page for our first project in MATH 237. Revolving around the Ames Housing dataset, our project seeks to explore how a house's lot size, the year in which it was built, its masonry veneer area, and its ground living area all affect its sale price. In particular, we complete the following tasks to analyze and answer these research questions:
1. Set Up the Dataset: Import all the necessary libraries, load the dataset, and look at every variable in further detail.
2. Handle the Missing Data: Find any missing variables, identify them appropriately, and use proper methods to take care of them.
3. Perform Feature Engineering: Use ratio features for some variables and binning for others; all while making histograms to show these features together.
4. Visualize the Data: Create histograms for all five variables and scatterplots for four of these variables.
5. Conducting Multiple Linear Regression: Split the data into a train-test set with the 80-20 split, construct a correlation matrix, scale these sets, train the model, interpret the coefficients, and finally evaluate both the train as well as the test sets.
* Note: For parts 3 (Performing Feature Engineering) and 4 (Visualizing the Data), we used the following key to distinguish the variables that we were measuring.
* Red – Lot Area in Square Feet
* Orange – Year Built
* Yellow – Masonry Veneer Area in Square Feet
* Green – Ground Living Area in Square Feet
* Blue – Sale Price in USD
