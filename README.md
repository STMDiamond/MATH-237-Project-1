# MATH-237-Project-1
Hello, and welcome to our project in MATH 237. This project was made by Sean Mitani and Preston Nguyen. Revolving around the Ames Housing dataset, the our project seeks to explore how a house's lot size, the year in which it was built, its masonry veneer area, and its ground living area all affect its sale price. In particular, we do the following things to answer these research questions:
1. Set Up the Dataset
2. Handle the Missing Data
3. Feature Engineering
4. Graphs
5. Multiple Linear Regression
