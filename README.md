# MATH-237-Project-1
Hello and welcome to the page for our first project in MATH 237. Revolving around the Ames Housing dataset, our project seeks to explore how a house's lot size, the year in which it was built, its masonry veneer area, and its ground living area all affect its sale price. In particular, we do the following things to answer these research questions:
1. Set Up the Dataset
   Import all the necessary libraries.
   Load the dataset.
   Look at every variable in further detail.
2. Handle the Missing Data
   Find any missing variables.
   Identify the ones in MasVnrArea as missing not at random (MNAR).
   Use listwise deletion.
3. Perform Feature Engineering
   Use ratio features for the house's lot area and the year in which it was built.
   Use binning for the house's masonry veneer area, its ground living area, and its sale price.
   Create histograms to show all of these features.
4. Visualize the Data
   Create histograms to show the house's lot area, the year in which it was built, its masonry veneer area, its ground living area, and its sale price.
   Create scatterplots to show the relationships between a house's lot area, the year in which it was built, its masonry veneer area, and its ground living area against its sale price.
5. Conducting Multiple Linear Regression
